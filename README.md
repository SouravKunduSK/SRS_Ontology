# SRS_Ontology

The ontology is developed to address challenges such as communication gaps, risks of errors, and inconsistencies during the manual process of creating Software Requirement Specifications (SRS). The proposed ontology provides a structured and formal representation of the requirements, improving consistency and communication among the stakeholders. The ontology is developed based on the software requirements documents to support the development process. Prot´ eg´ e is used for ontology construction and Pellet Reasoner is used for inference and to save and reuse information. Later, SPARQL queries are used to retrieve data.


How to use the Ontology:
1. Download the owl file
2. Incorporate it into Protege software.
3. Import your SRS data.
4. Go to the SPARQL query section, Write, and Execute the queries.
5. Enjoy!
